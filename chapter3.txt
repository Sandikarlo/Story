Yet it could have been better because later that evening i was going to be meeting a specific person. A person who i have been wanting to meet and talk to ever since the end of last summer. Everything was just like it was back then. I was finally feeling happy. Not only i had started earning good money, but life seemed to go in the desired direction all by itself. This is the best year of my life - i thought.
